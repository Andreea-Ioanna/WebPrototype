                    <br>
                    Copenhagen City Bikes was the bicycle sharing system of Copenhagen, Denmark. Launched in 1995 with 1,000 cycles, the project was the world's first organized large-scale urban bikesharing scheme, which, unlike its Dutch predecessor, featured what are now considered basic elements such as coin deposit, ﬁxed stands and specially designed bikes with parts that cannot be used on other bikes . Riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special bike stands and had unlimited use of a bike within the speciﬁed downtown area.
                    The scheme was funded by commercial sponsors.
                    In return, the bikes carried advertisements, which appeared on the bike frame and the solid-disk type wheels. When the programme was abolished in October 2012, some 1,500–1,700 bikes were still in service, out of a total of 2,500 put onto the streets.

                    Bycyklen (The City Bike) is synonymous with Copenhagen. In fact, the oﬃcial gift from The City of Copenhagen to American president Bill Clinton, when he visited Copenhagen in 1997, was a specially designed city bike called City Bike One.

                    Copenhagen had an extensive and well-designed system of cycle paths, earning it a reputation as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world . In recognition of Copenhagen's emphasis on bicycling, the city was chosen by the Union Cycliste Internationale as their ﬁrst oﬃcial Bike City .


                    Bike City Copenhagen covered the period 2008 to 2011 and consisted of big cycling events for professionals as well as amateurs.
                    The obvious way to get around Copenhagen is of course by bike and that is when the public bike share, Bycyklen, comes in handy. The Bycyklen bikes are available all over the city and are easy to use.


                    The city bikes are intelligent electric bikes that are available 24/7, 365 days a year. Each bike has a touchscreen tablet which can be used for navigation, payment and guidance to points of interest in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg.
